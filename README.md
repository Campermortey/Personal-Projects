My personal Projects

Most of these are works in progress but all are able to be run without issue. Each project usually iterates in complexity from previous projects. For example, "FlooringProgram" is a console application that makes use of basic and advanced C# concepts yet does not contain any SQL implementation or Asp.net. However, it does make use of abilities to read and write from files into the console.

"AppLabsWebVersion" converts common/difficult programming challenges designed for Console UI implementation into a Web version using Asp.net MVC.
